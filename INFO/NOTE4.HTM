<P>&quot;I love my love with an A&quot; was a popularparlor game in Victorian
England. The first player recited:<BR>
</P>

<CENTER><P>&quot;I love my love with an A because he's _________.<BR>
I hate him because he's ________.<BR>
He took me to the Sign of the _________.<BR>
And treated me with ________.<BR>
His name's _________.<BR>
And he lives at ________.<BR>
</P></CENTER>

<P>In each blank space the player used a suitable word beginning with &quot;A&quot;.
The second player then repeated the same lines, using &quot;B&quot; instaed
of &quot;A,&quot; and the game continued in this fashion through the alphabet.
Players unable to supply an acceptable word dropped out of the game. The
wording of the recitation varied; the lines quoted above are taken from
Jame Orchard Halliwell's <I>The Nursery Rhymes of England,</I> a book popular
in Carroll's day. </P>
